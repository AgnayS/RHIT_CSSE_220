Reflection Questions:

1.A In your implementation could you replace each Question class with just a Java String (yes or no)? 



1.B Explain why or why not? (2-3 sentences)

Yes it is possible to replace objects of questions with a java string. One could use a hashmap (similar to my implementation) to store the question id and  just the string, 
instead of redundantly assigning ids and strings for each object of type question.

2.A. What data type did you use to represent the 1-to-many relationship between QuizMain and Question? (provide the type declaration)

HashMap <Integer,Question> Questions = new HashMap<>();

2.B. What is another data type could you have used? (provide the type declaration) 

(I think most students would have used Arraylist to implement the question, and given the previous one i think hashmap would be the answer to this one, 
but i used a Hashmap in the first place, so my answer is)

ArrayList <Question> = new ArrayList<>();

2.C. Would that have made your implementation easier or harder to implement? Explain why? (2-3 sentences)

ArrayLists would have made the code cleaner if we used objects of type Question like the current code. (But accessibility would have been reduced)

However, If we chose to use ArrayLists WITHOUT objects of question, we would have to find the ids using loops for each given question query, which would have made implementing
this design substantially tougher.
